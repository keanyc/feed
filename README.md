feed v0.5

Just a RSS Feed Reader

This project is for testing frontend stuff(framework, plugin, design...etc).

Right now it will display my favorite websites' rss feed by default. You can add some feed by click on "Add Feed" on the left side(Mobile will be inside the nav icon) to enter "Title" and "URL"(ex: "Techcrunch" on the Title field and "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/" on the URL field). Press Enter then there you go! You will see it add to the list above "Add Feed" and show the content.

### Caution

For now the data you enter will save in Local Storage. That means it only save on your browser. If you change computer/device to another one then the data will not be there.

Feel free to leave comment on issues, email me to send push request to improve this. Many thanks!
